## Development Process

### Setting Up Your Environment

1. Fork and clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/website-replicator.git
   cd website-replicator
   ```

2. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. Create a `.env.local` file:
   ```bash
   cp .env.example .env.local
   # Add your OpenAI API key to .env.local for AI features
   ```

4. Run development server:
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

### Coding Standards

#### JavaScript Style Guide

- Use ES6+ features when appropriate
- Use async/await over callbacks
- Prefer const over let, avoid var
- Use meaningful variable names
- Add JSDoc comments for functions

Example:
```javascript
/**
 * Validates and processes a URL
 * @param {string} url - The URL to validate
 * @returns {Object} Validation result
 */
export async function validateUrl(url) {
  const result = { isValid: false, error: null };
  
  try {
    // Validation logic here
    const parsedUrl = new URL(url);
    result.isValid = true;
  } catch (error) {
    result.error = error.message;
  }
  
  return result;
}
```

#### React/Next.js Best Practices

- Use functional components with hooks
- Keep components small and focused
- Use proper prop types or TypeScript
- Handle loading and error states
- Make components accessible (ARIA labels, semantic HTML)

#### CSS Guidelines

- Use CSS modules or styled-jsx
- Mobile-first responsive design
- Follow BEM naming convention for classes
- Use CSS variables for theming

### Testing

#### Running Tests

```bash
# Run all tests
npm test

# Run tests in watch mode
npm run test:watch

# Run tests with coverage
npm run test:coverage
```

#### Writing Tests

- Write tests for all new features
- Aim for >80% code coverage
- Test edge cases and error conditions
- Use descriptive test names

Example:
```javascript
describe('URLValidator', () => {
  test('validates correct HTTPS URLs', () => {
    const result = validateUrl('https://example.com');
    expect(result.isValid).toBe(true);
  });

  test('rejects URLs without protocol', () => {
    const result = validateUrl('example.com');
    expect(result.isValid).toBe(false);
    expect(result.error).toContain('protocol');
  });
});
```
